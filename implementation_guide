## Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Define the Problem Clearly**

- **Action**: Clearly articulate the problem or decision to be made.
- **Tip**: Be specific to provide the AI with clear context.

### **Step 2: Generate Supporting Arguments**

- **Prompt**: Ask the AI to provide arguments in favor of a particular solution.
- **Example**: "What are the benefits of implementing a new customer feedback system on our website?"

### **Step 3: Generate Opposing Arguments**

- **Prompt**: Request counterarguments or potential drawbacks.
- **Example**: "What are the potential downsides or risks of implementing a new customer feedback system?"

### **Step 4: Evaluate and Reflect**

- **Action**: Encourage the AI to assess both sets of arguments objectively.
- **Prompt**: "Weigh the supporting and opposing arguments and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses."

### **Step 5: Assign Confidence Levels and Identify Biases**

- **Action**: Have the AI assign probabilistic confidence levels to each argument.
- **Prompt**: "Assign confidence levels to each argument and identify any potential cognitive biases that might affect the assessment."

### **Step 6: Adjust for Biases (Debiasing)**

- **Action**: Adjust the confidence levels after considering identified biases.
- **Prompt**: "Adjust the confidence levels accounting for any identified biases."

### **Step 7: Meta-Level Appeal Process Enhanced with Game Theory**

- **Action**: Reassess arguments from an external perspective and consider adversarial viewpoints.
- **Prompt**: "Consider how competitors might react if we implement this system and how that affects our decision."

### **Step 8: Sensitivity Analysis with Iterative Refinement**

- **Action**: Vary assumptions and assess how changes affect the outcome.
- **Prompt**: "How do different levels of customer engagement impact the decision to implement the feedback system?"

### **Step 9: Independent Verification**

- **Action**: Use alternative methods to validate the results.
- **Prompt**: "Are there other approaches to gathering customer feedback that we should consider?"

### **Step 10: Comprehensive Documentation**

- **Action**: Document all assumptions, limitations, and the decision-making process.
- **Prompt**: "Summarize the key findings, assumptions, and limitations of this analysis."

### **Step 11: Final Recommendation**

- **Action**: Have the AI provide a final, well-justified recommendation.
- **Prompt**: "Based on the analysis, what is the final recommendation regarding implementing the new customer feedback system?"

### **Step 12: Final Self-Check and Continuous Improvement**

- **Action**: Reflect on the process and identify areas for future improvement.
- **Prompt**: "Reflect on this decision-making process and suggest areas for improvement in future analyses."

### **Step 13: Resource Constraints Evaluation and Decision Optimization**

- **Action**: Before concluding, evaluate if additional resources would enhance the analysis.
- **Prompt**: "Considering our current resources, is further analysis likely to yield significant new insights?"
